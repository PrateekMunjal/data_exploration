# Docstrings for function description according to Google way.
To follow google's doc style: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

## WHY WE NEED IT IN SPHINX? 

As .rst is the standard way to use in sphinx, but it is a boring way of writing Docstrings.
On the other hand,
- Napoleon is a Sphinx extension that enables Sphinx to parse 
both NumPy and Google style docstrings - the style recommended by Khan Academy.

- Napoleon is a pre-processor that parses NumPy and Google style docstrings 
and converts them to reStructuredText before Sphinx attempts to parse them. 
This happens in an intermediate step while Sphinx is processing the documentation, 
so it doesn't modify any of the docstrings in your actual source code files.

Code Example

def func(arg1, arg2):
    """Summary line.

    Extended description of function.

    Args:
        arg1 (int): Description of arg1
        arg2 (str): Description of arg2

    Returns:
        bool: Description of return value

    """
    return True
